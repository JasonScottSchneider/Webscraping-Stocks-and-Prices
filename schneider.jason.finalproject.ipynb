    "## Program 1\n",
    "The CNN Moneyâ€™s Market Movers website (https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/) tracks the most active stocks on a real-time basis. Specifically, the most active, the top gainers and the top losers are listed at any instance in time. This program collects the list of most actives, gainers, and losers from the above website. Next, this program takes the ticker symbols and names of these companies (and categories) to build a csv file (called something like <b>20191201-212519.csv</b> in which the title of the csv is determined by the time created saving it as the output year/month/day-hour/minute/seconds.csv) with data about each stock from the website: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD?p=AMD&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1, which gives the quote for ticker symbol AMD as an example. The data to be collected from the Yahoo Finance site includes:<br>\n",
    "<blockquote>OPEN price<br>\n",
    "PREV CLOSE price<br>\n",
    "VOLUME<br>\n",
    "MARKET CAP</blockquote>\n",
    "This program also lists the names of the companies in the order and categories listed in the website https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ and prompts the user to choose a company to get the data on. Once the user chooses the company of interest, this program displays its corresponding data (Open, Prev Close, Volume, and Market Cap).<br>\n",
